Determine whether they’re actually a direct competitor. <br>
A blog’s audience, niche, and specific slant determine whether they're your competitor. <br>
The most important of these is their audience. If they serve a different public than you, then they’re likely not a competitor.<br>
Look at the blog’s branding, color palette, and theme. <br>
Colors and themes play a huge role in fitting into your niche. <br>
For example, a blog about eco-friendly products should likely use earthy tones instead of loud, unnatural colors.<br>
